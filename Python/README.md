# Python Algorithms

This directory groups algorithm exercises implemented in Python.

## Folders

- **Arrays and hashing**: Solutions for common array and hash-map problems such as Two Sum, Contains Duplicate, finding the top K frequent elements, grouping anagrams, and checking if two strings are anagrams.

Each subfolder contains self-contained scripts with a `Solution` class demonstrating a particular approach.
